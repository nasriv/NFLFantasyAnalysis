# NFLFantasyAnalysis

My passion for sports and data led me to start analyzing historic sports data to identify some trends in the overall sports landscape and to help better inform some of my friends who play fantasy football. After watching a Monday Night Football game, one question popped into my head..."NFL fantasy players typically draft QBs later on in the draft...why is that?"

This idea got me excited to develop a personal database of NFL historic statistics in order to answer some of these questions. Using Python, Pandas, BeautifulSoup (when needed) I built a simple HTML parser which copied NFL QB statistics from https://www.pro-football-reference.com/. This data was compiled by year and saved into various Excel CSV files for future extraction and in case the website eventually went down. 

The formal steps I took to building this data scraping framework is listed below:
